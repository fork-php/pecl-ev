Problem: move the class code separate files, then simply
========================================================

#include "loop.c"
#include "watcher.c"
#include "io.c"
#include "timer.c"

Somewhere in ev.c, or php_ev.h

C++? 
========================================================

Manipulations with similar watcher types, and the watcher type inheritance
might be done with C++ classes.  To wrap a C++ class is not difficult. To
compile libev with CXX is not a problem either.  But do I really need this?

I'll try to cope with pure C, then try to comlipe with C++.  It is also
possible to compile just some files with CXX, and some with the good old C.
intl extention has a cpp file and the rest are c and h ones, for instance.
